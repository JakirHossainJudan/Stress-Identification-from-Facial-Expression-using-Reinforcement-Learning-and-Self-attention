Real-Time Stress Identification from Facial Expression using PPO &amp; Self-Attention

This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system aimed at identifying stress using deep reinforcement learning (PPO) combined with self-attention mechanisms. Built with PyTorch, it processes emotion-labeled facial images to train a custom CNN + Self-Attention model, optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The system supports performance evaluation through accuracy, F1-score, precision/recall tables, and deep feature correlation heatmaps.

Key Features:

⚙️ Custom CNN + Self-Attention architecture

🧠 PPO-based training loop for robust emotion classification

📊 Visualization: Confusion matrix, metric plots, correlation heatmaps

📈 Detailed evaluation with precision, recall, F1, p-values
